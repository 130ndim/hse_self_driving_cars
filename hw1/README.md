# Homework 1
Write a node that gets pose of one turtle and makes another turtle moves to it.
 
## Usage

`docker build -t <tag> .`

`docker run -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 -it --name <container name> <tag>`

Now you can control the first turtle using arrow keys and the second one will chase it.
